This section really just contains one piece of code--but it's the code that decodes the encoded packets. If you're wondering why I also have the decoder return the correlated offsets in the encoded packet, it's actually solely for the purpose of making string parsing easier, as the encoded packet's string is already in basic utf-8 form, whereas the decoding logic turns it into the weird encoded format that I mentioned in the packet_sending_constructors section. It's just overall easier to work with.
